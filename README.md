# Week11-Challenge: Express

## Express

Express was used to allow the user to traverse multiple pages by the URL changing.  In this case, it allows the user to get from the home page to the notes page and also allows the user to see raw data from the routes that begin with /API.

## JSONS

JSON files were used to store the notes as a database, therefore, requiring that the file be read and written to using fs filesystem.
